# ry
small little python thing for rythm shards
## Prerequisites

Things you need:
- python3[.6]
- BeautifulSoup4

How to install them:

```
$ easy_install pip3  
$ pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
```
## Installation

Eventually I will write some kinda installs script. If anyone knows how to do that, dm me (ash#0001)

### macOS

- For now, download the `ry` file, and copy it into your `/usr/local/bin` directory
- DO NOT copy into `/usr/bin` as thats always dangerous
- You might have a permission error, in which case just run `sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/ry`

## Usage

Its really easy. Just type `ry <guild id>`

For example, `ry 331517548636143626`

Will output

```
Shard Number:  813
Cluster Number:  4

813 : CONNECTED
```

If it doesn't, try again.

## Why is it called `ry`

because its short
