# ry
small little python thing for rythm shards
## Prerequisites

Things you need:
- python3[.6]
- BeautifulSoup4

How to install them:

```
$ easy_install pip3  
$ pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
```
## Installation

Eventually I will write some kinda installs script. If anyone knows how to do that, dm me (ash#0001)

For now, download the `ry` file, and copy it inyo your `/usr/local/bin` directory

## Usage

Its really easy. Just type `ry <guild id>`

For exmaple, `ry 231471142685245440`

Will output

```
Shard Number:  813 
Cluster Number:  4 

Shard 813 - CONNECTED
```

If it doesnt, try again.
